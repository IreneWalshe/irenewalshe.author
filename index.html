                    <h2>About Irene Walshe</h2>

                    <p>Born in Ottawa, Canada to an Irish father (from whom she gets her imagination) and a Venezuelan mother. She lived in Maracaibo, Venezuela until 2003 when she moved to Florida. She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in political science from the Rafael Urdaneta University in 1984.</p>

                    <p>Taking the example of her writer grandmother, Mercedes Bermúdez de Belloso, Irene started writing very young. Since then, she edited her grandmother’s last poems. In 1991, she wrote her first children’s book “Para Cantar y Jugar.” She collaborated with the local newspaper in the children’s Sunday supplement paper for which she wrote short stories and articles. </p> 
                    
                    <p>She published “Dotson the Dachshund Goes to the Park” and “The Kueka Stone” (Archway Publishing, 2022). She has been a member of the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators since 2003. She has also published poems in online poetry groups. Her latest children’s book is “Good Night, Tree.”</p>
                        
                    <p>In 2021, she contributed to the creation of the “Mercedes Bermúdez de Belloso Children’s Poetry Contest” with an online theatre academy in Maracaibo. Also, she was part of the committee for the National Women Writers Conference “Mercedes Bermúdez de Belloso.” In 2001 and 2002, she was a judge for the Regional High School Theatre Contest. For her painting, she won first prize to earn publication in an online Venezuelan magazine. Additionally, she translates and composes music while teaching English.</p>
